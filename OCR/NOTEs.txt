NOTES while investigating:

1. How to evaluate OCR model?
Text matching evaluation: SequenceMatcher from difflib
    Measure similitary of output text with different input
    Original image  --> text1
    Noise image     --> text2
    Grayscale image --> text3

2. How to add noise to image to multiply training set?
3. How to build OCA model from scratch?
4. OCA frameworks/libraries:
- tesseract
- 

5. Open dataset to evaluate:
